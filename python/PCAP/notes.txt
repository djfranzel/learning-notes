Todo:
- need more work on modules! don't really understand how to create my own

Finished the final project, my approach was more procedural, while the suggested solution
was more OOP. Both work the same way, I suppose mine makes more sense to me. Might be a good 
thing to try and learn their way. Something about it seemed more extensible. 

Took an official practice test: 
Modules & Packages      67%
Exceptions              57%
Strings                 44%
OOP                     76%
Misc.                   91%

Total was 70%, the minimum required to pass

Need to work on strings, exceptions and brush up on others!

import p.m
p.m.f()

Above was a valid import (although would not likely be used) to access f()

dir() is a method that a module can be passed into to get contents

__str__ is called when printing an object

DivideByZero error is an instance of ArithmeticError - an error that is a child of the parent will be caught here

slicing a string does not error, simply will return empty strings for invalid indexes

'assert' will raise AssertionError if it fails, good to know for special catching of this error

accessing a non-existent index in a tuple will throw an exception index out of range 

the codepoint for 'a' is 97 and 'A' is 65, so codepoint is capital first, then lowercase

python escape sequence always begins with '\'

accessing an index in a string that doesn't exist results in an exception

'.isdigit()' method is part of the string object and will check if all chars are integers
evaluates false for '1.2' or floats etc., only true for integers

if calling a method in a class that uses the class to reference a method instead of 'self', then the 
self must be passed in the argument - otherwise, how would the method know the context?

when inheriting values from parent classes, all classes are considered in the context of the main class,
then references of a value in one of the parent classes references the nearest value, getting the one
in the main class if it exists

__bases__ is of type tuple that contains info about direct superclasses of this class

__dict__ will return lots of data on the class, and on the object instantiation, only the instance variables
