PCEP (Certified Entry-level Python Programmer)

Got 86% on the practice exam, 70% required to pass. 
Probably will not take this cert, and instead take the PCAP since it 
is more valuable and a challenge. 

bool, int, float, str, tuples are all immutable
list, dict, set are mutable

Todo:
- need to work on bit operators, not really familiar at all
