Vue is a framework for building websites. It is fast to develop and easy to maintain. 

HMR = hot module reloading

Vue can be added modularly to old applications
Angular may be better for giant corporate applications - why?

Vue 3 is faster, supports TS, smaller package

TS works automatically rather than with lots of config as in Vue 2
Uses tree-shaking which is a new tech that removes unneeded code - cool! always thought this would be great

Vue is unopinionated
Angular is opinionated

unopinionated - easy to learn, multiple ways to implement a task, developer style can vary
opinionated - harder to learn, less ways to implement tasks - leading to more similar code styles between developers

Vue needs a tool to manage state
needs external style libraries
needs additional containers for deployment
needs manual config of DB

Angular or other opinionated frameworks might have the above features, which may take more time to learn, 
but could result in better maintainability and even faster code, provided the dev knows the tools well
